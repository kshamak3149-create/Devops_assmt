# 🚀 DevOps Observability Assignment 

Welcome to my mini DevOps project that ties together reverse proxy, container orchestration, and observability in a clean, modular setup. This project runs two microservices behind an NGINX reverse proxy and uses Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is built with:

- 🐳 Docker Compose for orchestrating all services  
- 🔀 NGINX as a reverse proxy  
- ⚙️ Two microservices:
  - **Service 1:** Written in Go
  - **Service 2:** Built with Python (Flask)
- 📊 Prometheus for scraping metrics
- 📈 Grafana to visualize them

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
  

2. Launch everything:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the services:

| Service    | URL                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Service 1  | [http://localhost:8080/service1/ping](http://localhost:8080/service1/ping) |
| Service 2  | [http://localhost:8080/service2/ping](http://localhost:8080/service2/ping) |
| Prometheus | [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)                             |
| Grafana    | [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)                             |

🧠 **Default Grafana login:**
`Username: admin`
`Password: admin`

## 🔍 Observability Details

### ✔️ Prometheus

* Automatically scrapes metrics from both services at `/metrics`.
* Defined scrape configs in `prometheus/prometheus.yml`.

### 📊 Grafana Dashboards

* Prometheus is already set up as a data source.
* You can create panels or import pre-built dashboards.
* Example Dashboard ID for Prometheus stats: **1860**

### Example Metrics Exposed:

* `service1_http_requests_total`
* `flask_http_request_duration_seconds`
* System metrics like CPU, memory, GC are scraped but here it is not necessary

this is the custom dashboard i have created 
which shows service1 total requests,service 2 latancy,service 2 total requests.





## ✅ Health Checks

Each service includes Docker health checks that verify `/ping` endpoints regularly to ensure they're alive before proceeding with reverse proxy setup.

---

## 🔐 Security Highlights

* Basic NGINX headers to prevent clickjacking and XSS
* Services are isolated via a custom Docker network
* Lightweight base images (e.g., `alpine`, `python:slim`)

## 💡 Why this project?

I built this as part of a DevOps learning path to demonstrate my understanding of containerized environments, reverse proxying, service monitoring, and real-time visualization.

To prepare the application for modern, async-compatible infrastructure, this service wraps the Flask (WSGI) app using WsgiToAsgi from asgiref. This allows it to be run under an ASGI server like Uvicorn or Hypercorn, enabling compatibility with ASGI-based middleware and observability tools.

**However, please note:

While the application is ASGI-wrapped, Flask remains a synchronous framework. Wrapping alone does not improve throughput or concurrency, as true async behavior requires ASGI-native frameworks like FastAPI.

This architectural choice was inspired by a blog on FastAPI throughput, which highlights the importance of properly handling blocking I/O in async environments.
